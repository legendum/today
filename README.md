This project consists of a single Ruby file to be put in your "bin" directory.

Here's how to use the "today" command:

    > today help              - show this help info
    > today                   - list all tasks to finish today
    > today grep Bob          - find all tasks matching "Bob"
    > today get it finished   - add the task "get it finished"
    > today first ask Bob     - add "ask Bob" as a first task
    > today del               - remove top item from the list
    > today done              - remove and archive the top item
    > today done 2 3          - remove and archive items 2 & 3
    > today first 4 5         - move items 4 & 5 to top of list
    > today last 6 7          - move items 6 & 7 to end of list
    > today vi[m]             - edit the file listing the tasks

Simple huh?
